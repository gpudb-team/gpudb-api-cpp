Each file showcases the use of a particular GPUdb endpoint.  The filename reflects which endpoint is exemplified by that C++ file.

To compile any given example file, at the command prompt, run 'make filename_without_extensiton'.  For example, to compile example_status.cpp, run:

> make example_status
> ./example_status


Users may need to export the lib directory to the library path:

> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


If other paths need to be changed for other libraries, please refer to the instructions at the top of the Makefile.
